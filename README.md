# Pasta for Obsidian

Pasta is a collaborative note-taking and editing app built on top of Ethersync.

Ethersync provides the core engine for real-time collaborative editing of local text files. With it, multiple people can edit the same file simultaneously, making Pasta useful for activities such as shared notes or lightweight document editing.

## Caution

Pasta is currently in _Alpha_. This means:

- Handle your data with care. Documents may be lost or corrupted.
- Bugs are expected. Features may break or behave unpredictably.
- Breaking changes are likely. We’re iterating quickly, so storage formats, commands, or APIs may change without notice.

If you choose to use Pasta at this stage, please do so only with **non-critical** data.
