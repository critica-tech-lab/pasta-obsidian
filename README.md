# Pasta for Obsidian

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f098bbb1-2f6b-4bfb-a1f5-af0234995df4

Pasta is a collaborative note-taking and editing app built on top of Ethersync.

Ethersync provides the core engine for real-time collaborative editing of local text files. With it, multiple people can edit the same file simultaneously, making Pasta useful for activities such as shared notes or lightweight document editing.

## Caution

Pasta is currently in _Alpha_. This means:

- Handle your data with care. Documents may be lost or corrupted.
- Bugs are expected. Features may break or behave unpredictably.
- Breaking changes are likely. Weâ€™re iterating quickly, so storage formats, commands, or APIs may change without notice.
