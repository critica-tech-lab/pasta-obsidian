# Installation

## Activate Community Plugins

> [!NOTE]
> Pasta is not an official Obsidian plugin. To use it, you will need to enable community plugins in Obsidian, which grants extended permissions for third-party plugins developed by the community.

- Go to Obsidian > Settings ⚙️
- Open "Community Plugins" settings
- Read security instructions
- If you agree, click on "Turn on community plugins"

## Use BRAT 🟩

> [!TIP]
> BRAT (**B**eta **R**eviewers **A**uto-update **T**ool) is a handy Obsidian plugin that lets you install and test pre-release or non-community-store versions of other plugins or themes directly from GitHub.

- On "Community plugins" settings, click on "Browse"
- Search for "BRAT" by [TfTHacker](https://tfthacker.com/BRAT)
- Click on "Install", then on "Enable", then on "Options"
- Click on "Add beta plugin"
- Enter `https://github.com/critica-tech-lab/pasta-obsidian` in the _Repository_ field
- Select the `Latest` version
- Click on "Add plugin"
- Congrats! A new "Pasta" setting section is now available

## Install Ethersync binary

[!IMPORTANT]
Note: This will install a binary on your Obsidian Vault `(.ethersync/ethersync)`. If you prefer to use a system available binary, provide a custom _ethersync_ binary location path

- On "Pasta" settings, click on "Open Advanced settings"
- For _Ethersync location_, change to "Custom"
- Click on "Download 0.7.0", a path to the downloaded binary will be used to connect through Ethersync.
- To confirm, go back to _Pasta settings_ and click on the refresh button. A version of ethersync will be displayed.
