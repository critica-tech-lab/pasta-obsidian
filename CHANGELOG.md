## 0.0.1 (2025-07-27)

First release!

We're excited to share the very first public release of Pasta for Obsidian.

A few highlights:

- Obsidian-inspired UI: Focused on following Obsidian's UI guidelines to keep things familiar and easy to use.
- Ethersync integration: Real-time collaboration is already working, though there's plenty of room for improvement as we refine stability and performance.
- Keyboard-first workflow: Includes commands designed with keyboard-heavy users in mind, so you can stay in flow.

This is just the beginning: the app works but it's still early days. Expect bugs, rough edges, and fast changes as we move forward.
